%%%% Vectors %%%%
% Vx = [1+3i,2-2i];
% Vx' = 1-3i, 2+2i
% Vx.' = Vx
% Vrow' = Vrow as column
% Vcolumn' = Vcolumn as row
%
% for multiplication amount of rows V1 must match columns V2
% Same applies for division
%
% Dot product = .* => only when two vectors are of the same type
% thus either column or row
%
% Dot operator is used to square each element of the vector
% notated by using .^ I.E. gives the same as u .* u
%
%Dot division ./ => element by element division; only when
% vectors are of the same size And type
% A/0 = inf ; 0/0 = NaN
